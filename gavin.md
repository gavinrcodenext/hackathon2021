#### _Computer Science made Easy_
___
"Name" is a service that allows students to get a head start on one of the biggest, constantly evolving industry: **computer science**.
"Name" offers many different activities to develop future our young computer scientists' skills:

- Extensive courses on topics varying from Python to web design
- Projects for students to take on in order to practice their new knowledge gained from our courses.
- Educational games for students to enjoy 

### How to Start

1. Press the Sign-Up button in the top right corner to create your account.
2. Take the diagnostic survey. This will evaluate how much experience you have in computer science. Based on this survey you will be given a skill level. We will use your skill level to reccommend courses, projects and games to you so be honest!
3. If you are making an account for school, go to "Join a Class" and input the code your teacher gave you. If you are the teacher select "Create a Class" instead.
4. After watching the introductory video (or skipping it), everything is open to you! Every course, project and game will have a badge denoting its reccommended skill level. However, you can choose whatever you like. 
5. If you feel you are now a higher skill level, you can retake the diagnostic survey and recieve a higher skill level!
