	<p data-line-start="3" data-line-end="5">“Name” is a service that allows students to get a head start on one of the biggest, constantly evolving industry: <strong>computer science</strong>.<br>
	“Name” offers many different activities to develop future our young computer scientists’ skills:
		<ul>
			<li>Extensive courses on topics varying from Python to web design</li>
			<li>Projects for students to take on in order to practice their new knowledge gained from our courses.</li>
			<li>Educational games for students to enjoy</li>

		<li data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Take the diagnostic survey. This will evaluate how much experience you have in computer science. Based on this survey you will be given a skill level. We will use your skill level to reccommend courses, projects and games to you so be honest!</li>
		<li data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">If you are making an account for school, go to “Join a Class” and input the code your teacher gave you. If you are the teacher select “Create a Class” instead.</li>
		<li data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">After watching the introductory video (or skipping it), everything is open to you! Every course, project and game will have a badge denoting its reccommended skill level. However, you can choose whatever you like.</li>
		<li data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">If you feel you are now a higher skill level, you can retake the diagnostic survey and recieve a higher skill level!</li>
